This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The website is available on `localhost:3000`.

## Philosophy

It's time to BUILD ya know? And it's fun to make little greebles with your friends! Pair up with a pal and let greeble site be a playground for your imagination :)

## How to Contribute

1. Replace one of the grid items in Grid.tsx with your own Greeble (as described below).
2. Try to keep package and font imports to a reasonable level. Importing some stuff is okay and expected!
3. No other rules. Network requests, canvas, etc are all encouraged and welcomed.
4. Make a PR and Loopy and/or Cameron will review it (and possibly ask for small changes, but no outright rejections)

## Repo Architecture

All greebles and styles belong in `src/greebles`. Name each greeble file `ContributorName.tsx` or `ContributorNameDescription.tsx`, where `Description` is one or two or three words.
